# Accessibility 
## Description

Refractor the webpage for "Horiseon" to make it more accessible and optimized for search engines:

* As a developer, I want to add semantic HTML elements, add alt attributes to images, and configure a logical structure for my HTML file.

* Consolidate CSS selectors and organize them to follow the semantics of the HTML elements. I will make sure to add comments to elements of CSS.

* Application's links all function correctly.

## User Story
